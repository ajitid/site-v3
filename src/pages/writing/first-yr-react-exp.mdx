## Why am I writing this?

People say life is short, but we still forget things. So I wanted to record my experience as they are going to dwindle in the past anyway. This might also give me nudge to start working on my vocabulary (do something meme) and collect my findings at a single place so I can tell you about you all of it.

Tech CS/IT/EE in major service based companie. .. old tech.. doesn't mean its bad... 6LPA ... competitive programming... . On the contrary, I've asked opinions of people infy fine ().. if experience... scrum master (3-5 yrs)

communication matters over technical skill (you'll learn it, albeit slowly)
