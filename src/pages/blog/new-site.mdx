# Yup, new site with new tech

This one uses Next.js, MDX, twin.macro (TailwindCSS + Emotion) and react-spring. I'll probably add use-sound, FLIP animation and Shiki highlighter too, but before that I need to figure out how to export metadata of these .mdx files and consume them, list them in a page (with pagination, sorted by timestamp), link to go next and previous blogpost. Probably what I need to do is to move out `blog/` to `datasource/` and dynamically create last 30 pages sorted by date and rest being dynamically created (I'm using Next.js 9.3+).
